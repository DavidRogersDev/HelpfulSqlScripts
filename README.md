# HelpfulSqlScripts
Some General SQL scripts which help in the day-to-day operations of a developer.

I'm no SQL Server guru. In fact, SQL Server is probably the thing I know least about in the .NET development stack. So I generally rely on the expertise of others when I want to find out information of a meta-nature e.g. list all foreighn keys of a particular table, show me all tables which have a particular column named 'xyz'.

Sometimes it will just be a script which contains a syntax that I have forgotten.

So, I have created this repo to capture such scripts which I can call upon as an when.
